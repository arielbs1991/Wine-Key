Wine Key is an interactive wine inventory tool for Fire&Vine Hospitality. As a manager at a specific store location, one often finds that their restaurant is low on a requested bottle of wine that is required at a sooner date than it can be ordered and delivered by. With Wine Key, a manager is able to easily add, modify or delete items in their own location's wine inventory, as well as search for bottles that they need that may exist elsewhere within the company. Upon searching for a wine, a manager is presented with a list of each restaurant within the company that has that bottle of wine, which vintage they carry, how many bottles of each vintage they have, as well as the contact information for the store. As a busy manager, this search process will allow them to make one quick phone call to a store that they know does indeed carry the specific item they need as opposed to calling each location at random, thus saving an immense amount of time for all involved parties.

Given that the restaurants carry many of the same bottles of wine, it is important that each wine be added to the catalog only once, and that the specific inventories of that wine be updated individually so that the wine search yields accurate, concise information. This way, managers are able to see what wines exist within the company if they are considering incorporating a wine that is popular at another location, as well as have the ability to add an entirely new wine to not only their inventory, but to the company's catalog. The managers are also able to easily differentiate between what wine is simply out of stock vs a wine that is no longer available and needs to be erradicated from the catalog.

As a growing and changing company, it is also important for a manager to have the capability to modify information pertaining to their store, as well as add/delete a location that may be opened or closed in the future. Wine Key was produced in a way that enables dynamic page creation and styling, allowing for as many or as few restaurants to be incorporated to the database with their own corresponding inventories.
