//add wine: on click, needs to take the information from the three input fields within its div and create a new wine inventory item (wineId, restaurantId, and quantity). Will need a location.reload to display automatically. Will need to dynamically create a new line in the table with all table elements included (information and action buttons)
//update: "id specific" on click, needs to update the posted quantity of the unique id with the number entered into the input field, location.reload at the end
//remove: "id specific" on click, needs to remove all elements of the unique id from the database. location.reload at end

//NAVBAR: Home: should already be hooked up. Needs to be tested. Stores: will need same functionality as in index.handlebars "update inventory" dropdown menu. Hopefully can make accross-the-board interactive with classes. Wine Catalog: should be hooked up already, needs to be tested. Search: needs same functionality as the index.handlebars "search" button and field. Hopefully across the board functionality with class use
